## Modular audio-visual composition with VCV Rack and Unity {#modular-audio-visual-composition-with-vcv-rack-and-unity}

{{< figure src="/urack/static/urack-scrot.png" >}}

**URack** is a project that combines [the VCV Rack software modular synthesiser](https://vcvrack.com/)
 with [the Unity game engine](https://unity.com/), making for an audio-visual workstation that allows
 users to compose and perform music and graphics within the same software
 environment.

Like all modules in VCV, URack modules are controlled with control voltage â€”
allowing the user to tightly integrate sound with high-fidelity graphics by
sharing CV signals.
