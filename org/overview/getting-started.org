* Getting Started
Assuming you have already installed [[https://vcvrack.com][VCV Rack]] on your system, you can begin using
URack by downloading the *URack Player* below.

The URack Player is a runtime for URack modules that come packaged in plugins â€”
so by itself it's not much good. The *URack Collection* is a plugin developed by
/eidetic/ that includes modules for manipulating images, 3D point-clouds, lights
and cameras. Follow the instructions for [[./#installing-plugins][Installing Plugins]] below to get started
creating audio-visual compositions.

** Downloads
Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available here:
+ [[https://eidetic.net.au/urack/downloads/player/][URack Player]]
+ [[https://eidetic.net.au/urack/downloads/collection/][URack Collection]]

** Installing Plugins
URack plugins contain two components:
1. A plugin for VCV Rack.
2. A plugin for the URack Player.

The VCV Rack plugin component is installed by dropping the corresponding archive
into the 'Rack user folder' on the system you wish to use as your VCV Rack host.
The location of the 'Rack user folder differs' depending on your platform:
+ Windows: ~My Documents/Rack/~
+ Linux: ~~/.Rack/~
+ macOS: ~Documents/Rack/~

The URack Player plugin is installed similarly, by dropping the corresponding
plugin archive into an adjacent 'URack user folder' on the systems you wish to
use to render your graphics.
+ Windows: ~My Documents/URack/~
+ Linux: ~~/.URack/~
+ macOS: ~Documents/URack/~

Plugins are separated into these two components to facilitate the scenario where
the URack Player is running on a separate device to the VCV Rack host. There is
no need to install the VCV Rack plugin components on devices used solely for
rendering graphics, and no need to install the URack Player plugin components on
the machine running only VCV Rack.
