* Point Clouds
URack introduces a new value type into VCV Rack. On top of control voltages and
audio, URack is able to pass *point cloud* data from module-to-module.

A point cloud is a collection of points in 3D space. In the context of URack, it
can be used to display vertices stored in a 3D model, stream input from a
depth-camera, or reconstruct a scene captured using photogrammetry. Point cloud
manipulation can create some stunning visualisations â€” particularly when
combined with algorithmic noise, or rendered with light simulations.

Point cloud cables are thick like polyphonic cables, and feature a white stripe
to differentiate them.
