* Modular audio-visual composition with VCV Rack and Unity
[[./images/urack-scrot.png]]

*URack* is a project that combines [[https://vcvrack.com/][the VCV Rack software modular synthesiser]]
 with [[https://unity.com/][the Unity game engine]], making for an audio-visual workstation that allows
 users to compose and perform music and graphics within the same software
 environment.

 Like all modules in VCV, URack modules are controlled with control voltage â€”
 allowing the user to tightly integrate sound with graphics by sharing CV.
